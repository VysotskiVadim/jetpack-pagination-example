# Example of Jetpack Paging 2.

Supports following features:
* Pagination 
* Remove item from the list;
* Pull to refresh;
* Error handling;
* Clean architecture
_(unit test isn't done in example, but trust me, it easy to implement because you don't have to mock odd data sources from the library)_;
* Integration with Kotlin Coroutines.
